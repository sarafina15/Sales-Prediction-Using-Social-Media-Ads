# Sales-Prediction-Using-Social-Media-Ads
ðŸ“°The primary goal of this project is to predict future sales based on the influence of social media advertising. By leveraging time series analysis, we aim to model the relationship between advertising campaigns and sales performance over time. This will help businesses make informed decisions regarding their marketing strategies and optimize their advertising spend.
Time series forecasting is a technique that uses historical data to make predictions about future events. In this case, past sales data from a company is analyzed to predict future sales. 
Predicting sales of a company needs time series data of that company and based on that data the model can predict the future sales of that company or product.
Predicting whether a customer will purchase a product is a form of classification problem. Social media data can be leveraged to understand customer sentiments, behaviors, and preferences
Social media data will predict whether a customer will purchase or not purchase.
